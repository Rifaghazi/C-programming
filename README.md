C programming practice repository

This repository contains basic C programs created to practice programming fundamentals.
It includes programs on loops, arrays, functions, and structures.

This repository is part of my learning journey as a 1st-year BCA student.


**How to use?**
1. Open the repository:  https://github.com/Rifaghazi/C-programming.git
2. Open any `.c` file in a C compiler (like Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, or Visual Studio Code).
3. Compile and run the program to see the output.
4. Feel free to explore and modify the programs to understand them better.


**My Learning Journey**

This project is part of my ongoing learning journey in programming. I plan to expand it with more advanced concepts in the future.
